        name="Candace O'Shea"
        important="What they did was nothing short of a miracle - turning someone who hated math and felt stupid into someone who could confidently handle math problems and succeed."
        review="Words are inadequate to express my thanks to Murray Math Tutoring.  Their ability to connect with my son, to motivate and encourage him was truly outstanding.  With their expert guidance, they  helped my son (who was seriously failing and way behind) to not only pass math but to close the year with a very positive final. They explained math in such a way that my son understood the concepts and could apply them in test settings. As he said to me, 'Taylor explains it do that it makes sense.  She actually helps me.' What they did was nothing short of a miracle - turning someone who hated math and felt stupid into someone who could confidently handle math problems and succeed And in a short amount of time. I could not recommend them more highly."

        review="I have used Brian and Taylor over the past two years and have been very happy with the experience. I have recommended them to several people  which has turned into a regular tutoring schedule. They are very accommodating and work hard to find what is best for your schedule. We meet weekly and often before a quiz or test and it has been very beneficial."
